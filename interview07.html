    <h2>INTERVIEW / ETHICS RESPONSES</h2>

    <p>Operator: HOLLY</p>

    <p>Q1: Where were you born, and what was your childhood like?<br> A1: I was born in Finland, and my childhood was rather normal and peaceful.</p>

    <p>Q2: Did you have any family in the military, law enforcement, or security work?<br> A2: My mother hasn't been in the military, law enforcement, or security work, but my father served the time that every man has to serve in the Finnish military.</p>

    <p>Q3: When and why did you decide to join a PMC or military organization?<br> A3: I first joined the DS approximately 4 months ago, and then joined this PMC when I was first notified of it. The reason as to why I decided to join in the first place, despite having no experience, was due to it sounding interesting, and the promise of comrades who stay loyal to each other and fight together as a proper team to restore order in sites that seem otherwise lost, was very appealing. It is safe to say that I do not regret that decision to this day.</p>

    <p>Q4: Which units, teams, or organizations have you served in previously?<br> A4: I have served in the medical unit and have not been in any other organizations other than the Death Saints.</p>

    <p>Q5: What was your first real mission or operation?<br> A5: My first real operation was around the time that I joined. I do not remember much about it, except staying by Seraph's side.</p>

    <p>Q6: What is the most memorable operation or mission you’ve been part of?<br> A6: The most memorable operation/mission I was a part of was most likely the first one, as I have not been in many other operations or missions after that.</p>

    <p>Q7: Have you ever been injured or faced serious danger during a mission?<br> A7: I have not been injured in any mission yet, and I don't believe that I've faced any serious danger.</p>

    <p>Q8: Have you ever lost someone important during an operation?<br> A8: So far, I have not lost anyone important during an operation.</p>

    <p>Q9: How would teammates describe your personality in the field?<br> A9: Efficient, fast, precise.</p>

    <p>Q10: Are you more of a leader, follower, or lone operator?<br> A10: I would say that I am a natural leader, I like the role itself, and I find it rather suitable for myself, although I am also a good follower when it comes to it.</p>

    <p>Q11: Have you ever had disagreements with superiors or teammates?<br> A11: I don't recall having any disagreements with superiors or teammates whatsoever. And even if/when I do, I tend to find ways to sort it out to come to an agreement.</p>

    <p>Q12: What drives you to continue working in high-risk operations?<br> A12: The fact that I can help people in the way I know how to, drives me to continue working in high-risk operations.</p>

    <p>Q13: Do you have any personal habits, quirks, or routines that stand out?<br> A13: I believe that my love for writing, reading, and doing art might stand out. For context, I find it easy to write, especially when it comes to handbooks and instructions.</p>

    <p>Q14: What specialized skills or expertise do you bring to operations?<br> A14: I bring my skills of healing and the ability to move swiftly from one injured to another, keeping the combatants alive for longer during operations.</p>

    <p>Q15: Do you have personal goals or ambitions outside of PMC work?<br> A15: I do have a few goals outside of PMC work, that being finishing my school, as well as continuining writing my book, possibly publishing it at some point, keeping my community in check, and whatever other projects come to me along the way.</p>
